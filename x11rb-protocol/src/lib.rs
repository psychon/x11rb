//! X11 rust bindings.
//!
//! This crate provides a representation of the X11 protocol in Rust. With this protocol, raw X11
//! bytes can be parsed into a structured representation or raw bytes can be produces.
//!
//! This protocol does not do any I/O. If you need an X11 client library, look at
//! <https://docs.rs/x11rb/latest/x11rb/>.
