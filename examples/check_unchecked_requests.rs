// This program shows error handling. It causes some X11 errors and shows where they end up.
//
// This program also serves as a (bad) integration test. To verify that the expected behaviour
// occurs, it needs to do some extra work. In particular, all calls to .sequence_number() are not
// needed for the example, but only for the test. Where needed, extra comments indicate how the
// short version of each case would look.
