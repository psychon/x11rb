//! Generic connection-related types and definitions.
//!
//! This module contains the `Connection` trait and related definitions. The code in this module is
//! used by each concrete implementation of the X11 protocol.
//!
//!
//! # Handling X11 errors
//!
//! The X11 server can answer requests with an error packet for various reasons, e.g. because an
//! invalid window ID was given. There are three options what can be done with errors:
//!
//! - Errors can appear as X11 events in `wait_for_event()` (in XCB, this is called "unchecked")
//! - Errors can be checked for locally after a request was sent (in XCB, this is called "checked")
//! - Errors can be completely ignored (the closest analog in XCB would be `xcb_discard_reply()`)
//!
//! There is an additional difference between requests with and without replies.
//!
//! ## Requests without a reply
//!
//! For requests that do not have a reply, you get an instance of `VoidCookie` after sending the
//! request. The different behaviors can be achieved via interacting with this cookie as foolows:
//!
//! | What?           | How?                       |
//! | --------------- | -------------------------- |
//! | Treat as events | Just drop the cookie       |
//! | Check locally   | `VoidCookie::check`        |
//! | Ignore          | `VoidCookie::ignore_error` |
//!
//! ## Requests with a reply
//!
//! For requests with a reply, an additional option is what should happen to the reply. You can get
//! the reply, but any errors are still treated as events. This allows to centralise X11 error
//! handling a bit in case you only want to log errors.
//!
//! The following things can be done with the `Cookie` that you get after sending a request with an
//! error.
//!
//! | Reply  | Errors locally/ignored             | Errors as events          |
//! | ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
//! | Get    | `Cookie::reply`                    | `Cookie::reply_unchecked` |
//! | Ignore | `Cookie::discard_reply_and_errors` | Just drop the cookie      |
