//! X11 rust bindings.
//!
//! This library allows to interact with an X11 server from rust code. A connection to an X11
//! server is represented by an implementation of the `Connection` trait.
//!
//! The client can interact with the server by sending requests. The server can answer requests and
//! can also generate events.
//!
//! The examples that come with this library might be a good starting point for new users.
