//! X11 rust bindings.
//!
//! This library allows to interact with an X11 server from rust code. A connection to an X11
//! server is represented by an implementation of the `Connection` trait.
//!
//! The client can interact with the server by sending requests. The server can answer requests and
//! can also generate events.
//!
//! The examples that come with this library might be a good starting point for new users.
//!
//!
//! # Getting started with X11
//!
//! X11 is a big protocol. I would claim that most of it is not actually that complicated, but it
//! is still difficult to get into it. A good starting point might be some [libxcb
//! tutorial](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/libxcb/tutorial/index.html). This tutorial
//! was adapted in this crate [as an
//! example](https://github.com/psychon/x11rb/blob/master/examples/tutorial.rs). A more in-depth
//! look at the X11 protocol can be gained from the [protocol reference
//! manual](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html), but this requires some
//! existing basic understanding of X11. If you want to figure out what some specific request does,
//! be sure to look it up in the specification!
//!
//! Most extensions can be understood by reading their specification. Most of them can be found
//! [here](https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/index.html#protocol). For example, [the
//! specification of Composite
//! 0.4](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/compositeproto/compositeproto.txt) consists of
//! about six pages of text.
//!
//! The notable exception is the X keyboard extension, which is documented in a [PDF file with 168
//! pages](https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.pdf) which I am never going to
//! read completely.
//!
//!
//! # Getting started with x11rb
//!
//! Most code in this code is automatically generated from an XML description of the protocol. This
//! is the same approach as taken by [libxcb](https://xcb.freedesktop.org/) (and in fact this uses
//! the same XML description). This means that if you know your way around X11, most things should
//! be obvious to you.
//!
//! For example, here is how to create a new window with x11rb:
//! ```no_run
//! use x11rb::connection::Connection;
//! use x11rb::errors::ReplyOrIdError;
//! use x11rb::protocol::xproto::*;
//! use x11rb::COPY_DEPTH_FROM_PARENT;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let (conn, screen_num) = x11rb::connect(None).unwrap();
//!     let screen = &conn.setup().roots[screen_num];
//!     let win_id = conn.generate_id()?;
//!     conn.create_window(
//!         COPY_DEPTH_FROM_PARENT,
//!         win_id,
//!         screen.root,
//!         0,
//!         0,
//!         100,
//!         100,
//!         0,
//!         WindowClass::InputOutput,
//!         0,
//!         &CreateWindowAux::new().background_pixel(screen.white_pixel),
//!     )?;
//!     conn.map_window(win_id)?;
//!     conn.flush();
//!     loop {
//!         println!("Event: {:?}", conn.wait_for_event()?);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//! More examples can be found in the
//! [examples](https://github.com/psychon/x11rb/tree/master/examples) directory.
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//!
//! This crate uses [feature
//! flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-features-section) to reduce
//! the amount of compiled code. By default, only the core X11 protocol and X11 extensions that are
//! needed internally are enabled. Further extensions need to be explicitly enabled via their
//! feature flag:
//!
//! `composite`, `damage`, `dpms`, `dri2`, `dri3`, `glx`, `present`, `randr`, `record`, `render`,
//! `res`, `screensaver`, `shape`, `shm`, `sync`, `xevie`, `xf86dri`, `xf86vidmode`, `xfixes`,
//! `xinerama`, `xinput`, `xkb`, `xprint`, `xselinux`, `xtest`, `xv`, `xvmc`.
//!
//! If you want to take the "I do not want to think about this"-approach, you can enable the
//! `all-extensions` feature to just enable, well, all extensions.
//!
//! Additionally, the following flags exist:
//! * `allow-unsafe-code`: Enable features that require `unsafe`. Without this flag,
//!   `x11rb::xcb_ffi::XCBConnection` and some support code for it are unavailable.
//!
//!
//! # Integrating x11rb with an Event Loop
//!
//! The [event_loop_integration](event_loop_integration/index.html) module contains some hints for
//! integrating x11rb with an event loop as doc comments.

// This lint suggests a function that was added in Rust 1.40.0. Since our minimum supported version
// is Rust 1.37.0, just disable the lint.
